 * calculating the volume of a cylinder: area of circle X lnegth
 * 
 * volume of pipe is volume of outer -minus- inner
 * 
 * length x (pi x rxr (area of circle) = total volume of cylinder
 * 
 * user diameter/2 x 90% = inner radius
 * 
 * inner radius x inner radius x pi x length = inner volume
 * 
 * volume of pipe = total volume of cylinder - inner volume.
 * 
 * now work out the grade of plastic based on user input ... 
 * If pipe grade = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
 * the cost per inch is x: 0.3, 0.32, 0.35, 0.4 or 0.46
 *
